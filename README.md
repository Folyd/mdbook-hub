# mdbook-hub

The hub for mdbook.

## What is mdbook-hub?

`mdbook-hub` is a decentralized book hosting platform for books generated by `mdbook`. If `mdbook` is the `librustdoc`, then `mdbook-hub` is the `docs.rs`.

## Why mdbook-hub?

`mdbook-hub` aimed to bring the best publishing, and hosting experience to `mdbook` users. Imagine, we run `mdbook publish` in the directory of *The Rust Programming Language Book*, we can publish the book with the unique url `https://mdbook.org/rust-lang/book` effortlessly, no Github Pages setup required, no CI required.

Just like we `cargo publish`, we can publish our crate on crates.io and get a unique url on docs.rs.

> mdbook has no `publish` subcommand yet, we need to add it.

## How mdbook-hub works?

`mdbook-hub` mainly has two concepts:

- User
- Book

### User

The user is the organization or individual who owns the book (the author of the book). Every user has a unique handle, such as `rust-lang` (organization), `folyd`(individual). The `https://mdbook.org/{handle}` is the profile page to list all of public books of this user. For example, we can visit `https://mdbook.org/rust-lang` to view all books from Rust official.

### Book

Just an ordinary book generated by `mdbook`. However, the book must have at least one author. If a user is the author or co-author of a book, the user profile page can display this book.

Every published book has its unique url. For instance, the `https://mdbook.org/rust-lang/book` is the book whose id is `book` owned by `rust-lang` user.

Yes, this is like the relationship between a GitHub user and a GitHub repository.  So, you can get why we call **mdbook-hub**.

## Technical design

`mdbook-hub` is very similar to the combination of `crates.io` and `docs.rs` technically, except it is for books.
